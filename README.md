# Express Movie Database


<p>For this project, I've built a small Movie database using node.js, sqlite, sequelize and express.js. For testing, I've taken advantage of the jest testing framework to ensure my code ran smoothly.</p>

<p> I also made use of a kanban board for tasking out each piece of the project with a Jira board and create an entity relationship diagram to plan out my models beforehand. I found postman to be really helpful in making sure my routing was correct.</p>

Below are images related to my process.
